Hi Naari,

Looking forward for the response from you on this email. Please let me know if I need to 
include anyone else in the loop. 

Please share the roles and responsibilities discussed last week in an email so that we can 
use that as reference for discussions.

It's only 6 weeks and with no major contribution yet from my side (as the client says so), 
there isn't any transition I would have to do to my replacement.

With the given roles and responsibilities and the existing work environment and the existing 
team, I want to discontinue from this project immediately as it doesn't align with my ways 
of working and the work ethics. And as you too suggest last week that if required you will 
find a replacement for me for this project if roles don't match, please let's go ahead with 
that plan.

I don't see any learnings and any constructive work I can do being in this project.

Today, I spoke to team members individually and have started delegating tasks including 
KT documentation and estimation to the respective responsible leads. I sent an email with 
next steps and did not attend any meetings today.

Please let me know when this will be conveyed to the client, requesting you to release me 
as soon as possible.

Also, I will not be able to be work after 6 pm for next few weeks due to some personal 
family commitments,  I will login early to meet the required hours.

Thanks,
Barani

Subject: concern 
 
Hi Nari,

 
We need to urgently address some critical issues regarding my current involvement in the 
Numeracle project. Given the severity of these concerns, I request an immediate 
reassignment to another project.
 
1.	After six weeks on this project, I find myself stuck in daily transactional tasks with 
no sign of meaningful engagement or professional growth. This situation doesn’t 
look right and is not aligned with my career goals or the expectations I had for this 
role.
 
2.	My role was initially defined as supporting the Numeracle development team to 
enhance their engineering skills. However, I’ve been thrust into a dev lead, BA, and 
project manager role, all at once. This shift, combined with a team that is visibly 
unmotivated and a client more focused on just getting things done—regardless of 
the team’s well-being—has made this role increasingly unmanageable and 
demoralizing.
 
3.	The client has also expected me to step in and complete developers' work if they 
were unable to meet deadlines. I don’t want to work that way, as doing so would 
undermine the developers by making them feel they have a backup, which could 
discourage accountability and growth. I have done a small POC myself before 
handing over to the developer. Have written a good amount of Junits and shared 
with the developer as the initial step for their learning.
 
4.	I’ve been tasked with overseeing design and delivery while being explicitly advised 
not to rely on the team members. This approach is fundamentally flawed. Without 
empowering the team with accountability and broader exposure, the project is very 
close to becoming a bottleneck centred on one person, making it highly vulnerable 
to failure.
 
5.	The recent management change has demoralized the team, with several members 
already considering their exit. The environment is one of disengagement and team is 
reluctant to contribute, which is not good. Requirements doesn’t come clearly from 
once source and lot of changes will have to be made after a good amount of 
development which is also fine but the questions that are asked of why it was 
implemented in a particular way is not going well with the team. Instead a concrete 
once source of requirement before the start of development is the best way to go. 
No proper backlog of tech stories with details.
 
6.	The work environment is rough, with discussions consistently one-sided. The lack of 
interest from the team in learning or taking proactive steps has restricted adopting 
new changes and made it nearly impossible to drive progress in engineering 
perspective.
 
7.	I am being asked to sign off on knowledge transfer (KT) and documentation, despite 
clear disinterest from the team and no interest from the management to make the 
team responsible. Given my limited understanding of the product and code, I 
cannot in good conscience sign off without commitment from all involved.
 
8.	The client manager demonstrates a complete lack of transparency and belief in the 
team members' capabilities, including seniors with 9 to 15 years of experience. This 
absence of respect and trust is demoralizing and is severely restricting the project’s 
potential for success, creating an environment filled with uncertainty and 
frustration.
 
9.	In my previous client project at Maveric, I was assured that my next role would align 
with my designation. Despite not raising concerns in the past, the current 
circumstances have pushed me to a point where I cannot maintain any motivation 
or satisfaction in this role.
 
Given the critical nature of these issues, I strongly urge an immediate reassignment to a 
project that aligns with my role and expertise. Continuing in this environment is not only 
unproductive but also detrimental to my professional growth and well-being.
 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to discussing this in person next 
week.
 
Thank you, 
Barani
